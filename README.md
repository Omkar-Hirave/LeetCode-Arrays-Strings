## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a variety of coding problems that involve the manipulation and processing of arrays and strings. Each problem comes with a detailed solution implemented using Java. The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for practicing and improving your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of arrays and strings.

I have tried my best to find the most optimized solutions for each problem. For many problems, I have explored the LeetCode discussion section and other resources to identify the best approaches. In some cases, the solutions provided here may represent the best approach you can come across for that particular problem.

Feel free to explore the problem sets and solutions. If you come up with an alternative solution or want to add a new problem to the collection, contributions are welcome!
